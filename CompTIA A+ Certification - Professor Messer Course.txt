			portable audio
		Not the highest quality
		Often stereo
			may include sub

	System board
		Proprietary
			built to fit

			Swap the entire board
			Most components are on the system board

	CPU
		Designed for mobility
			power management
		Integrated features
			memory controller
			video controller
		Not very upgradable
